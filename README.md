The personal, minimalist, super-fast, no-database delicious clone.  

You want to share the links you discover ? Shaarli is a minimalist delicious clone you can install on your own website.  
It is designed to be personal (single-user), fast and handy.  

### Original features:

 * FAST  
 * Dead-simple installation: Drop the files, open the page. No database required.  
 * Easy to use: Single button in your browser to bookmark a page  
 * Save url, title, description (unlimited size). Classify links with tags (with autocomplete)  
 * Tag renaming, merging and deletion.  
 * Automatic thumbnails for various services (imgur, imageshack.us, flickr, youtube, vimeo, dailymotion…)  
 * Automatic conversion of URLs to clickable links in descriptions. Support for http/ftp/file/apt protocols.  
 * Save links as public or private  
 * 1-clic access to your private links/notes  
 * Browse links by page, filter by tag or use the full text search engine  
 * Permalinks (with QR-Code) for easy reference  
 * Tag cloud  
 * Picture wall (which can be filtered by tag or text search)

 * Automatic ban of IP address upon too many failed logins  
 * Protected against XSRF, session cookie hijacking.  
 * Automatic removal of annoying FeedBurner/Google FeedProxy parameters in URL (?utm_source…)  
 * Shaarli is a bookmarking application, but you can use it for micro-blogging (like Twitter), a pastebin, an online notepad, a snippet repository, etc.  
 * You will be automatically notified by a discreet popup if a new version is available  
 * Pages are easy to customize (using simple RainTPL templates)
